## 0.2.0

First version worth using. Covers the bookkeeping core, sales, purchase, and bank
reconciliation and VAT, runs either locally over stdio or as a self-hosted remote
connector, and has been verified against live ReAI data throughout.

### Added

- **63 tools**: 56 across four accounting domains, plus 7 always-on
  (orientation and discovery, which no configuration can disable).
  - *Bookkeeping* (8) — chart of accounts, VAT codes, vouchers, postings, general
    ledger. `reai_create_voucher` checks the debit/credit balance locally and
    reports the exact imbalance rather than letting the API return a bare 422.
  - *Sales* (22) — customers, products, orders, offers, invoices, customer ledger.
  - *Purchase* (13) — suppliers, supplier invoices, the document inbox, EHF
    parsing, expenses, supplier ledger.
  - *Bank & VAT* (13) — company accounts, the reconciliation view, reconciliation
    rules, transaction matching and booking, VAT settlement, tax return.
- **Discovery escape hatch** (part of the 7 always-on) —
  `reai_search_endpoints`, `reai_describe_endpoint`, `reai_list_api_tags`,
  `reai_api_notes` and `reai_request` reach all 323 documented operations, so the
  266 with no curated tool are still usable.
- **A write policy**, which is the core safety contract. Every operation is
  classified `read` / `reversible` / `irreversible` and gated by
  `REAI_WRITE_MODE` (default `reversible`). Tools a mode forbids are never
  registered, so an agent cannot attempt them, and the escape hatch classifies
  each call by method *and* request body — an unrecognised write path fails
  closed.
- **Remote connector mode** — Streamable HTTP with a full OAuth 2.1
  authorization server: dynamic client registration (RFC 7591), authorization
  code + PKCE (S256 only), protected-resource metadata (RFC 9728), AS metadata
  (RFC 8414), refresh tokens. ReAI issues static API tokens and has no OAuth of
  its own, so the consent page bridges the two.
- **Sealed tokens instead of a session store.** The user's ReAI token, the tenant
  they chose and the write ceiling are encrypted into the access token with
  AES-256-GCM, purpose-bound so one token type cannot be replayed as another.
  Any instance can serve any request, which is what makes a scale-to-zero
  deployment practical with no database.
- **A tenant bound at authorization time is a boundary, not a default** — a grant
  scoped to one company cannot address another, even though the underlying ReAI
  token may reach dozens.
- **47 known API quirks** keyed to the operations they affect, surfacing
  automatically in discovery. Request shapes that differ from what an endpoint
  name suggests, constraints the schema omits, multi-step workflows, and
  operations that are harder to undo than they look.
- **`REAI_TOOLSETS`** to narrow the curated surface to
  `bookkeeping` / `sales` / `purchase` / `bank`. Orientation and discovery are
  never disabled.
- **`scripts/deploy-cloud-run.sh`** — one command, running as a dedicated service
  account with no project-level roles, pinning `PUBLIC_URL` and every hostname
  Cloud Run serves, and failing non-zero when the result is not actually
  reachable.
- **Four live verification harnesses**: `smoke.mjs` (read-only, safe against
  production books), `smoke-write.mjs` (a reversible round-trip), `smoke-http.mjs`
  (the whole OAuth flow as a real client) and `smoke-full-write.mjs` (posts and
  deletes a real voucher). All assert the negative cases too, not just the happy
  path. Both write scripts refuse to run unless the tenant is named in
  `REAI_WRITE_TEST_TENANTS` — a tenant id on the command line is not consent.
- A build step compressing the 907 KB OpenAPI snapshot into a 195 KB searchable
  index.
- CI across Node 20, 22 and 24, plus a check that the published package contains
  what it should.
- **`scripts/ci-local.sh`**, which runs everything that workflow runs, on every
  Node version in its matrix. Written during a multi-hour GitHub Actions outage,
  when no workflow could start at all — "wait for a green tick" is not a quality
  gate while the service producing the tick is down. It says outright that it is
  not a CI run, because it cannot reproduce the clean-room `npm ci` on Linux, and
  it skips-with-warning rather than silently passing when a Node version is
  missing locally.

### Fixed

Found by review — Codex on each pull request, plus independent subagent reviews.
Recorded because most were reachable in the default configuration:

- **The write policy could be bypassed by path traversal.** Classification ran on
  the raw string while the URL was built with `new URL()`, which resolves dot
  segments — so `POST /api/customers/../vouchers` was classified against the
  reversible `/api/customers` prefix and posted to the general ledger. Paths are
  now canonicalized once and the same value is both classified and requested.
- **A supplier payment could start a real bank transfer.** `manualPayment` was
  optional and the API defaults it to `false`, selecting the bank-integrated flow
  that can return an approval URL beginning a BankID payment — while the tool
  described itself as merely recording an already-paid invoice. It is now
  required, and an approval URL is reported as *not yet paid*.
- **The VAT tool claimed to file returns.** `POST /api/vat-returns` settles and
  locks the period; it submits nothing to Skatteetaten. Retitled, with the
  distinction stated in the description and the success message.
- **A lost response could book a voucher twice.** The client retried any request
  on a gateway error or timeout, including `POST /api/vouchers`, which has no
  idempotency key — so a write that ReAI had already committed could be repeated,
  and the duplicate cannot simply be deleted once the period closes. Retries after
  an *ambiguous* failure are now limited to methods where repeating is harmless;
  `429` is still retried for every method, because it is rejected before being
  processed. `REAI_MAX_RETRIES=0` also works now — it was rejected by a shared
  "must be positive" check, which made the safest setting unexpressible.
- **A partially numbered voucher hit the row-merge error it was meant to prevent.**
  Row assignment bailed out as soon as *one* posting carried a `rowNumber`,
  leaving the others defaulted to row 0; an explicit row 0 plus an unnumbered
  posting with a different description then failed to merge. Explicit rows are now
  honoured while unnumbered postings are fitted around them.
- **Refresh tokens could be rolled forward indefinitely.** Grants now carry an
  authorization time and are clamped to a 90-day absolute ceiling.
- Two questions the tools advertised answering were answered wrongly: "who owes
  us money" and "what is overdue" both silently excluded items older than a
  recent window.
- Subscriptions with `outputMode: "create_invoice"` and reconciliation rules are
  now treated as irreversible, because both let ReAI issue postings with no
  further call.
- Quirks matched by prefix, so parent advice leaked onto unrelated
  sub-operations — `POST /api/invoices/{id}/email` was told to send an `orderId`.
  Matching is exact unless a quirk opts into descendants.
- Cloud Run serves a service on more than one hostname, and the OAuth flow
  completed on an alias before every MCP call failed with `Invalid Host header`.
  All hostnames are now allowed.
- `reai_use_tenant` was a no-op in stateless remote mode: it reported success and
  the next request discarded it.

### Known limitations

- **The tenant boundary is enforced by this server, not by the API.** ReAI ignores
  `X-Tenant-Id` when a token reaches only one company — every value, including a
  nonexistent id, returns that company's data. Isolation between *users* is
  intact, but we could not verify that the API enforces a tenant switch, because
  every token available for testing reaches exactly one company. The guarantee
  holds for calls made through these tools and says nothing about the same token
  used directly.

- **Individual tokens cannot be revoked** before they expire. Sealed tokens carry
  no server-side record, so rotating `REAI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — which invalidates
  every authorization at once — is the remedy.
- **Serving under a path prefix is unsupported.** A `PUBLIC_URL` containing a
  path, query or fragment is rejected at startup rather than half-working.
- **Two `npm audit` advisories** come from transitive dependencies of
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (`hono`, `fast-uri`). Neither is on this server's
  request path; they clear when the SDK bumps them.
- **No sandbox exists** for ReAI. Write paths are therefore verified against a
  real but empty tenant, and three of them are still untested end to end:
  issuing an invoice or credit note (it transmits, and cannot be recalled),
  registering a payment, and settling a VAT period or filing a tax return (both
  change a real company's period state). Everything else — ledger postings, the
  supplier-invoice chain, bank accounts and reconciliation rules — has been
  posted to live books and cleaned up again, with the tenant verified empty
  afterwards.
