## 0.2.0

First version worth using. Covers the bookkeeping core, sales, purchase, and bank
reconciliation and VAT, runs either locally over stdio or as a self-hosted remote
connector, and has been verified against live ReAI data throughout.

### Added

- **63 tools**: 56 across four accounting domains, plus 7 always-on
  (orientation and discovery, which no configuration can disable).
  - *Bookkeeping* (8) — chart of accounts, VAT codes, vouchers, postings, general
    ledger. `reai_create_voucher` checks the debit/credit balance locally and
    reports the exact imbalance rather than letting the API return a bare 422.
  - *Sales* (22) — customers, products, orders, offers, invoices, customer ledger.
  - *Purchase* (13) — suppliers, supplier invoices, the document inbox, EHF
    parsing, expenses, supplier ledger.
  - *Bank & VAT* (13) — company accounts, the reconciliation view, reconciliation
    rules, transaction matching and booking, VAT settlement, tax return.
- **Discovery escape hatch** (part of the 7 always-on) —
  `reai_search_endpoints`, `reai_describe_endpoint`, `reai_list_api_tags`,
  `reai_api_notes` and `reai_request` reach all 321 documented operations, so the
  264 with no curated tool are still usable.
- **A write policy**, which is the core safety contract. Every operation is
  classified `read` / `reversible` / `irreversible` and gated by
  `REAI_WRITE_MODE` (default `reversible`). Tools a mode forbids are never
  registered, so an agent cannot attempt them, and the escape hatch classifies
  each call by method *and* request body — an unrecognised write path fails
  closed.
- **Remote connector mode** — Streamable HTTP with a full OAuth 2.1
  authorization server: dynamic client registration (RFC 7591), authorization
  code + PKCE (S256 only), protected-resource metadata (RFC 9728), AS metadata
  (RFC 8414), refresh tokens. ReAI issues static API tokens and has no OAuth of
  its own, so the consent page bridges the two.
- **Sealed tokens instead of a session store.** The user's ReAI token, the tenant
  they chose and the write ceiling are encrypted into the access token with
  AES-256-GCM, purpose-bound so one token type cannot be replayed as another.
  Any instance can serve any request, which is what makes a scale-to-zero
  deployment practical with no database.
- **A tenant bound at authorization time is a boundary, not a default** — a grant
  scoped to one company cannot address another, even though the underlying ReAI
  token may reach dozens.
- **48 known API quirks** keyed to the operations they affect, surfacing
  automatically in discovery. Request shapes that differ from what an endpoint
  name suggests, constraints the schema omits, multi-step workflows, and
  operations that are harder to undo than they look.
- **`REAI_TOOLSETS`** to narrow the curated surface to
  `bookkeeping` / `sales` / `purchase` / `bank`. Orientation and discovery are
  never disabled.
- **`scripts/deploy-cloud-run.sh`** — one command, running as a dedicated service
  account with no project-level roles, pinning `PUBLIC_URL` and every hostname
  Cloud Run serves, and failing non-zero when the result is not actually
  reachable.
- **Four live verification harnesses**: `smoke.mjs` (read-only, safe against
  production books), `smoke-write.mjs` (a reversible round-trip), `smoke-http.mjs`
  (the whole OAuth flow as a real client) and `smoke-full-write.mjs` (posts and
  deletes a real voucher). All assert the negative cases too, not just the happy
  path. Both write scripts refuse to run unless the tenant is named in
  `REAI_WRITE_TEST_TENANTS` — a tenant id on the command line is not consent.
- A build step compressing the 907 KB OpenAPI snapshot into a 195 KB searchable
  index.
- CI across Node 20, 22 and 24, plus a check that the published package contains
  what it should.
- **`scripts/ci-local.sh`**, which runs everything that workflow runs, on every
  Node version in its matrix. Written during a multi-hour GitHub Actions outage,
  when no workflow could start at all — "wait for a green tick" is not a quality
  gate while the service producing the tick is down. It says outright that it is
  not a CI run, because it cannot reproduce the clean-room `npm ci` on Linux, and
  it skips-with-warning rather than silently passing when a Node version is
  missing locally.

### Fixed

Found by review — Codex on each pull request, plus independent subagent reviews.
Recorded because most were reachable in the default configuration:

- **The write policy could be bypassed by path traversal.** Classification ran on
  the raw string while the URL was built with `new URL()`, which resolves dot
  segments — so `POST /api/customers/../vouchers` was classified against the
  reversible `/api/customers` prefix and posted to the general ledger. Paths are
  now canonicalized once and the same value is both classified and requested.
- **A supplier payment could start a real bank transfer.** `manualPayment` was
  optional and the API defaults it to `false`, selecting the bank-integrated flow
  that can return an approval URL beginning a BankID payment — while the tool
  described itself as merely recording an already-paid invoice. It is now
  required, and an approval URL is reported as *not yet paid*.
- **The VAT tool claimed to file returns.** `POST /api/vat-returns` settles and
  locks the period; it submits nothing to Skatteetaten. Retitled, with the
  distinction stated in the description and the success message.
- **A lost response could book a voucher twice.** The client retried any request
  on a gateway error or timeout, including `POST /api/vouchers`, which has no
  idempotency key — so a write that ReAI had already committed could be repeated,
  and the duplicate cannot simply be deleted once the period closes. Retries after
  an *ambiguous* failure are now limited to methods where repeating is harmless;
  `429` is still retried for every method, because it is rejected before being
  processed. `REAI_MAX_RETRIES=0` also works now — it was rejected by a shared
  "must be positive" check, which made the safest setting unexpressible.
- **A partially numbered voucher hit the row-merge error it was meant to prevent.**
  Row assignment bailed out as soon as *one* posting carried a `rowNumber`,
  leaving the others defaulted to row 0; an explicit row 0 plus an unnumbered
  posting with a different description then failed to merge. Explicit rows are now
  honoured while unnumbered postings are fitted around them.
- **Refresh tokens could be rolled forward indefinitely.** Grants now carry an
  authorization time and are clamped to a 90-day absolute ceiling.
- Two questions the tools advertised answering were answered wrongly: "who owes
  us money" and "what is overdue" both silently excluded items older than a
  recent window.
- Subscriptions with `outputMode: "create_invoice"` and reconciliation rules are
  now treated as irreversible, because both let ReAI issue postings with no
  further call.
- Quirks matched by prefix, so parent advice leaked onto unrelated
  sub-operations — `POST /api/invoices/{id}/email` was told to send an `orderId`.
  Matching is exact unless a quirk opts into descendants.
- Cloud Run serves a service on more than one hostname, and the OAuth flow
  completed on an alias before every MCP call failed with `Invalid Host header`.
  All hostnames are now allowed.
- `reai_use_tenant` was a no-op in stateless remote mode: it reported success and
  the next request discarded it.

Found by a second round of review, aimed at ground the first had not covered —
the HTTP transport, the build and deploy pipeline, and the result formatter:

- **A grant with no bound tenant had no tenant boundary at all.** The write mode
  was re-clamped against current config on every request, for the right reason: a
  sealed grant is unforgeable but not fresh. The tenant was never re-checked, and
  the binding was applied only when the grant carried one — so a grant issued
  before the consent flow began failing closed reached every company its ReAI
  token could see, stayed valid for the full 90-day ceiling, and was re-minted on
  every refresh. Both redemption and refresh now refuse them.
- **The deploy script's `--env` silently overrode its own safety gates.** gcloud
  keeps the last occurrence of a key, and extra pairs were appended after the
  script's own, so `--env REAI_WRITE_MODE=full` bypassed the confirmation prompt
  and `--env REAI_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SEND=1` armed EHF/Peppol — while the closing
  summary printed the safe values, because it read local shell variables. Managed
  keys are refused with a pointer to the real flag, and verification now reads the
  deployed revision back.
- **`REAI_ALLOW_TOKEN_PASSTHROUGH` survived redeploys** onto a service this script
  always publishes `--allow-unauthenticated`, which is the one combination the
  README says never to create. Reset on every deploy unless passed again.
- **One POST could take the container down.** `/mcp` handed the raw stream to the
  SDK, which parses with no limit; a 400 MB body exhausted the heap. Capped at
  8 MB. A JSON-RPC batch was unbounded too — 1000 entries produced 1000 concurrent
  upstream calls, and the write policy is applied per call, so it never saw the
  aggregate. Capped at 50.
- **An oversized body wedged the connection**, unauthenticated: it answered
  nothing further and was not closed either, sitting open until the 128-second
  socket timeout. Now 413 and closed — and delivered reliably, which took draining
  the body before answering, since closing with unread data makes the OS send RST
  and an RST discards the response already in the client's buffer.
- **Enums were published truncated and unmarked**, at 8 values in the index and 12
  in `reai_describe_endpoint`. `GET /api/vouchers` advertised 8 of its 16 voucher
  types, so an agent asked for VAT-return vouchers would conclude the filter did
  not exist. Array-valued enums lost their values entirely.
- **The spec-index builder had no assertions**, so a spec that lost its tags built
  cleanly as "430 operations, 0 public" — an empty discovery surface, exit 0. It
  now fails rather than writing a plausible degraded index.
- **Truncation could return an empty body** under a note describing content that
  was not there: plain text has no line boundary to cut back to, so a 40,000-
  character response came back as the note alone.
- **`GET /mcp` opened an SSE stream that could never carry anything** in stateless
  mode, with no server-side lifetime — 400 concurrent held GETs consume the
  per-instance concurrency Cloud Run allows. It answers 405, which the spec
  permits.
- Protocol-relative request targets (`//mcp`) routed by their authority rather
  than their path, so a POST to what a client believed was the MCP endpoint was
  answered with the HTML status page.

### Changed

- **Eight operations hidden by the `*-ctrl` tag heuristic are now discoverable.**
  The heuristic is right about the other 77 — UI typeahead, Adyen and Shopify
  webhooks, point-of-sale auth — but registering a payroll payment is not an
  undocumented internal, and hiding it made an agent report the capability as
  absent, which is worse than refusing because it is false. Five further
  candidates were dropped for duplicating a documented endpoint and one for taking
  an object-valued query parameter `reai_request` cannot send; both rules are
  enforced by tests. This does not widen what may be called: `internal` is a
  discovery flag, not a policy boundary, and every one of the writes classifies as
  irreversible, so the default `reversible` mode still refuses them.

### Known limitations

- **The tenant boundary is enforced by this server, not by the API** — and this is
  still unverified rather than known false. ReAI ignores `X-Tenant-Id` when a token
  reaches only one company: every value, including a nonexistent id, returns that
  company's data. Isolation between *users* is intact, but whether the API enforces
  a tenant *switch* could not be tested, because every token available during
  development was tenant-scoped and reached exactly one company.

  The spec says a **user-scoped** token behaves differently — `X-Tenant-Id` is
  "required for tenant-scoped requests when authenticating with a user access
  token" — so this is testable the moment one exists: list two companies from
  `GET /api/me`, read a known record from each, and check the header actually
  selects between them. Until then the guarantee holds for calls made through
  these tools and says nothing about the same token used directly.

- **Individual tokens cannot be revoked** before they expire. Sealed tokens carry
  no server-side record, so rotating `REAI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — which invalidates
  every authorization at once — is the remedy.
- **Serving under a path prefix is unsupported.** A `PUBLIC_URL` containing a
  path, query or fragment is rejected at startup rather than half-working.
- **Two `npm audit` advisories** come from transitive dependencies of
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, and the earlier claim here that neither is on this
  server's request path was wrong. `fast-uri` (HIGH, host confusion via a
  backslash authority introducer) reaches us through `ajv`, and **both are loaded
  into the running process** — the SDK uses ajv to validate protocol messages, so
  the module is on the path even though we have found no route by which
  attacker-controlled input reaches the vulnerable authority parsing. "We could
  not find one" is not "there isn't one", and it is the wrong standard for a HIGH
  in the runtime tree. `hono` (MODERATE, ReDoS in CORS middleware) is a narrower
  case: the SDK uses `@hono/node-server`'s request listener on every `/mcp` call,
  but not hono's CORS middleware — this server sets its own CORS headers — so the
  vulnerable code is not reached.

  Both are fixed upstream, and both are held by the 7-day minimum-release-age
  policy this project follows against supply-chain attacks: `fast-uri@3.1.5` was
  published 2026-07-31 and clears 2026-08-07, `hono@4.12.34` was published
  2026-08-03 and clears 2026-08-10. Adding the overrides before then fails
  `npm install` outright with ETARGET.
- **No sandbox exists** for ReAI. Write paths are therefore verified against a
  real but empty tenant, and three of them are still untested end to end:
  issuing an invoice or credit note (it transmits, and cannot be recalled),
  registering a payment, and settling a VAT period or filing a tax return (both
  change a real company's period state). Everything else — ledger postings, the
  supplier-invoice chain, bank accounts and reconciliation rules — has been
  posted to live books and cleaned up again, with the tenant verified empty
  afterwards.
